 This project is created using Angular CLI for frontend and Java with Spring Boot on backend.
 There are two Spring applications implementing RESTful web services that work with MySQL and MongoDB databases.
 There are two types of users: Admin and clients. When creating new account users will become clients.
 Clients can search store, select items and add them to cart, change information about their profile, cancel orders and rate bought items.
 Admin can get report with sale information for all or selected items per month per year including count of sold items per month and total earnings.
 
 ## Future improvements
 Since most application features are for store clients i would like to add Admin panel with all necessary features for store owners.
